	<h3 class="heading">First Fit</h3>
	First Fit allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate 
	the process. It starts searching from the beginning of the memory and assigns 
	the process to the first block that meets the size requirement. 
	This technique is simple and efficient but can lead to significant fragmentation.

	<h3 class="heading">Best Fit</h3>
	Best Fit allocates the smallest available memory block that is just large enough 
	to hold the process. It searches through the entire memory and selects the block 
	that results in the smallest amount of wasted space. This technique 
	reduces fragmentation, but it requires more time for searching the entire memory.

	<h3 class="heading">Worst Fit</h3>
	Worst Fit allocates the largest available memory block to the process. It searches through the entire memory and assigns the process to the largest block, leaving behind a larger amount of wasted space. This techniqu
	increases fragmentation but can be useful when large processes need to be 
	allocated.

	<p>
	<h3 class="heading">Next Fit</h3>
	Next Fit is an extension of the First Fit technique that starts searching for
	the next available block from the location where the previous allocation took 
	place. It reduces the search time compared to First Fit as it continues the 
	search from the last allocated
	position. However, it may still result in fragmentation similar to First Fit.</p>
